##My Motivation
My Motivation to create games is to immerse players into a world that takes thier minds off whatever elese is going on in the real world and get lost into a new world with limitless possibilities. Be through through farming adn crafting to puzzles one may have to face in order to recieve quest items. 
##influential games 
Influential games to me growing up was Zelda: the ocarina of time. Playing that game I was lost in the world of Hyrule. I have never played an open worl map that allowed me to explore the lands on horseback or even go fishing in a pond. 
##Hope to create
I hope to create a game where players can feel the world they are playing. like in the ghost of yotei where youre standing in the grass field and it feels like youre watching a movie. that is the immersion i want to create.
